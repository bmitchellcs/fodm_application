# Technical Interview for FO Data Manager

This repository contains instructions and relevant data to complete exercises in preparation for the technical interview.

There are two exercises.

## 1) Data Normalization

Please reference the table contained in 'normalization.csv'. Please use https://dbdiagram.io/ to create a database schema diagram. Let the schema adhere to as many of the normal forms as possible. Be prepared to explain your decisions. Upload a png of your diagram to your submission commit.

## 2) Analytic App

Please create a streamlit app (https://streamlit.io/) which will allow the user to answer the question, 'For a given crypto asset, what is the relationship between it's price performance and the performance of the crypto market? How has that changed over time? Begin with beta (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp)' Let 'crypto market' refer to the total USD value of all crypto assets in the dataset for a given day.

Find your underlying dataset in the streamlit_app folder.
