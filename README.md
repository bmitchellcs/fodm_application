# Technical Interview for FO Data Manager

This repository contains instructions and relevant data to complete exercises in preparation for the technical interview.

## This is not a test!

These exercises are meant to illustrate how you would approach solving problems related to the role. 

We ask that you submit your work within 3 hours of your start time. You may not finish. That, in itself, is not a problem. Be prepared to explain how you approached the problem and progressed toward a solution within the timeframe.

There are two exercises.

## 1) Data Normalization

Please reference the table contained in 'normalization.csv'. Please use https://dbdiagram.io/ to create a database schema diagram. Let the schema adhere to as many of the normal forms as possible. Be prepared to explain your decisions. Upload a png of your diagram to your submission commit.

## 2) Analytic App

Please create a streamlit app (https://streamlit.io/) which will allow the user to answer the question, 'For a given crypto asset, what is the relationship between it's price performance and the performance of the bitcoin? Begin with beta (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp)' Add charts and other data/measures/descriptors as you deem relevant.

Find your underlying dataset in the streamlit_app folder.


## Submission

Please create a branch with your first name and commit/push your work to that remote branch. Please do this within three hours of starting the exercise. Please include a requirements.txt file. 

The exercise is meant to help understand how you tackle analytical problems using code. If you should run into technical or configuration issues, do your best to overcome them and be prepared to explain what you did and why.
